# Health-Risk-Prediction-Dataset-Pipeline
 This project provides a **synthetic dataset (2000 rows)** and **end-to-end pipeline code** for developing and testing non-invasive health risk prediction tools.  

  All data is synthetic and rule-based. It is intended for **prototyping, model development, and UI validation only** — not for clinical use.

## Features
- **Non-invasive inputs**: waist/hip/height, resting heart rate, blood pressure, SpO₂, sleep, activity, lifestyle factors.
- **Optional glucose values**: ~40% missing to simulate real-world finger-prick availability.
- **Derived features**: waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body adiposity index (BAI), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse pressure.
- **Synthetic labels**: diabetes risk tiers, hypertension status, proxy 5-year CVD risk.
